    What I love about OpenAI is they don't spend $100M/year on tech evangelists on Twitter to hype their tech like many companies here do

    They don't do any marketing really

    The product sells itself as @sama mentioned in the presentation this week

    There's no hype, it's real tech

    Genghis Khan, a figure of immense historical significance, successfully unified the Mongols, forging an expansive empire that extended from China to Europe. Despite this legacy, the whereabouts of his tomb continue to elude discovery, as he specified a burial devoid of any markers or signs.

    Legend holds that, on his deathbed, Genghis Khan expressed a final wish to be interred near his birthplace along the Onon River in Mongolia. In accordance with this desire, upon his death on August 25, 1227, at the age of 65, soldiers carefully transported his body to the chosen tomb for his eternal rest.

    In a dramatic twist, Genghis Khan purportedly issued orders himself that mandated the brutal murder of anyone who bore witness to his burial. This drastic measure was intended to safeguard the secrecy surrounding the location of his tomb. Consequently, the final resting place of Genghis Khan stands as one of Asia's enduring enigmas, a mystery that persists through the ages.

    In this 1925 photograph captured by French photographer Marcelin Flandrin during a flight on the Casablanca-Dakar air route, a lone lion traverses the desert, possibly one of the last Barbary lions in the wild before their extinction.

    Barbary lions once roamed the expansive deserts and mountains along the Barbary coast in North Africa, from modern-day Morocco to Egypt. Noted for their dark manes, these lions were captured for Roman colosseum games, where they played a role in "condemnation to beasts" executions.

    The decline of Barbary lions continued with the Arab empire's expansion from 632 to 1258, as the Islamic Golden Age came to an end. Despite the turmoil and empires falling, Barbary lions endured until European colonists arrived in the 19th century. The rise of big-game hunting during this period led to the demise of the remaining population. No Barbary lions were sighted from 1901 to 1910, and by the 1920s, they were believed extinct.

    While reported sightings occurred in 1948 in Morocco and 1958 near Sétif, Algeria, the Barbary lions' habitat was destroyed during the Algerian War. Today, approximately 100 captive lions carry Barbary lion genes, but none are purebred.
